# Navy Cadet Parade Role Planner

by Indiana Daikee


---

## Project Description

At Navy Cadets, we have parade roles that need to be fulfilled by different people each week. Tracking how many times people have done each role and allocating roles to people weekly are things we struggle to do effectively.  As such, this database-driven web app solves these problems with the following features:

- Individual user account login, including admins with elevated permissions
- Tracking of personal statistics over the past 10 weeks
- Tracking and display of everyone's statistics over the past 10 weeks
- Allocating parade roles
- Creating, editing, and deleting roles

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 3**, assessed against standards [91902](docs/as91902.pdf) and [91903](docs/as91903.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **complex database techniques**:
- Structuring the data using multiple tables
- Creating queries which insert, update or delete to modify data
- Creating customised data displays from multiple tables (e.g. web pages)
- Dynamically linking data between the database and a front-end display
- Applying data access permissions as appropriate to the outcome

The project demonstrates a number of **complex digital media (web) techniques**:
- Using non-core functionality
- Using sophisticated digital effects
- Applying industry standards or guidelines
- Using responsive design for use on multiple devices
- The integration of original media assets
- Using dynamic data handling and interactivity
- Automation through scripts
