# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Accessiblity

I've made sure to use colour to supplement, and not be the main feature, of buttons etc. For example, the role delete button is red, which may be indistiguishable from green to a colourblind person - but the red is only one indication that the button deletes - it also clearly says "delete", and a confirmation popup also shows:

I've also selected a readable font size, and checked with stakeholders (including older officers with impaired vision) that it is easy to read.

Buttons are also big and easy to press.


### Functionality

To make sure my website works as intended and expected by my end-users, I've placed a big focus on gathering feedback and making relevant changes, and this can be seen through all three of my development sprints.

I also got users from both end-user groups to do a final test to make sure everything works logically, removing bias from me who understands everything.


### Ethics

One of the purposes of my website is to allocate parade roles more fairly. At the beginning of my project, I considered adding a warning message when allocating the same user for the same role to offten. Often, though, there is a good reason for someone to be repeating the same role, so I've instead decided that the table on the unit statistics page is the best way for senior rates / officers to allocate roles fairly where possible.

I've also made sure that the language on the personal statistics page isn't demeaning - e.g., it says "role last done 7 weeks ago," rather than "you are not pulling your load with this role."


### Aesthetics

When I was prototyping my design in sprint 1 and refining it in sprint 3, I was continuously working with my end-users to make sure that my choices of colour scheme, fonts, and element positioning were aesthetically pleasing, while still being functional and accessable.


### Usability

Throughout prototyping and development, I've sought end-user feedback to maximise my website's ease of use and predictability. When I made design choices, I evaluated these against Nielsen's usability heuristics (UX principles):

- Consistency and Standards - I've stuck to established conventions, such as positioning the nav bar at the top of the page and using widely understood icons
- Error prevention - When commiting to an irreversible action, such as deleting a role, a confirmation popup is shown to give users an escape from mis-clicks.
- Aesthetic and Minamalist Design - I've made sure that my site's design is simple and displays only the neccesary information, depending on whether the user is a junior or senior rate / officer.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
