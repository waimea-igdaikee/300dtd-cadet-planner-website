# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

At Navy Cadets each week we have certian parade roles (e.g. parade commander, quartermaster, bosun's mate) that need to be fulfilled. Every week, the roles are the same, but should ideally be taken by different people so that each role's work is spread roughly equally across the unit over the course of a term. People can volunteer for a role, however if no-one has put themselves forward for a role by Monday (we parade on Tuesday), then that role gets allocated to someone.

Currently, this process of volunteering / allocating involves long-winded WhatsApp message chains to figure out who wants to do what. In order to distribute the roles fairly, we rely on people remembering how many times they've done each role recently - and unfortunately, people's memories aren't quite as reliable as we need.

The problem we have is that it's quite difficult:
- To quickly know who is doing what this current week
- For people to volunteer for a role
- For senior rates / officers to allocate someone a role
- To track how many often each person has done each role


## End-User Requirements

The end users for this website would be everyone that attends the local Navy Cadet unit. This can be split into two main categories of end users, each with different expectations and requirements of the site:

**Junior Rates**

- Have an individual login
- Expect an obvious and easy-to-use interface that showing which roles are free or taken (and who by) for the current and next week. This interface will mostly be used on mobile phones but must still be desktop compatible
- Need a way to easily accept a role for the current or next week
- Need an obvious way to see if when they've been allocated a role
- Should be able to see an overview / description of each role in case they've forgotten
- Can see their stats over the past term i.e. how many times they've done each role

**Seniors Rates and Officers**

- All of the above needs for Junior rates (everyone does parade roles, not just junior rates), plus:
- The ability to see a chart / graph / figure of some kind showing who is 'pulling their load' over the term with respect to fulfilling roles
- The ability to assign people roles
- The ability to add, edit, and remove roles - though the roles are the same each week, we might make changes to the parade format two or three times a year, meaning the roles would have to be changed.


## Proposed Solution

A database-driven web application that meets the above needs by having:
- A user account login system. This will be linked up to the database, which records when each person has done each role
- Two simple main interfaces for everyone:
    - One showing all the parade roles for this and next week, along with who has taken this role. If no-one has taken that role, there should be a button for the logged-in user to volunteer for that role.
    - Another showing that user's statistics over the past 10 weeks - how many times they have done each role.
- An aditional interface for senior rates and officers, showing a unit-wide overview of who is 'pulling their load' in regard to doing each role
- Some way for senior rates and officers to allocate an untaken role to someone.
