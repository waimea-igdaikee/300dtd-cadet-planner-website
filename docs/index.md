## Project Description

This project is a database-driven web application, inteded to simplify the allocation of parade roles at cadets. It has the following features:

- A user account login system. This will be linked up to the database, which records when each person has done each role
- Two simple main interfaces for everyone:
    - One showing all the parade roles for this and next week, along with who has taken this role. If no-one has taken that role, there should be a button for the logged-in user to volunteer for that role.
    - Another showing that user's statistics over the past 10 weeks - how many times they have done each role.
- An aditional interface for senior rates and officers, showing a unit-wide overview of who is 'pulling their load' in regard to doing each role
- Some way for senior rates and officers to allocate an untaken role to someone.
