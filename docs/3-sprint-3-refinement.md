# Sprint 3 - A Refined and Complete System


## Sprint Goals

Develop the system until it is fully featured, with a refined UI and it satisfies the requirements. The system will be fully tested at this point.

## Updated Database Schema

After fitting the site to mobile devices, we have a problem on the unit stats page:

![Table squashed too small for headings](screenshots/unitStats1.png)

I tried rotating the headings to get the to fit, but even this didn't work:

![Table squashed too small for rotated headings](screenshots/unitStats2.png)

As such, I've spoken with the officers and they think that assigning each role a short abbreviation is best. This should be fine, as the only people with access to this page will know what each abbreviation is - but, considering my relevant implication of accessibility, I will add a tooltip when hovering just in case someone isn't sure.

As such, I've updated my database to give each role an abbreviation:

## Updated Colour Scheme

Now that my website was fully functional, it was time to add colour. 

I showed the final colour sceme to my stakeholers:

![Peach-coloured table](screenshots/allocations_table_1.png)

While they all liked the colour, some members, particually [certian stakeholder group] found it hard to read, therefore accessibility was bad. To maximise accessibility while keeping the aesthetically pleasing colour scheme, I have made the table itself white to maximise contrast, while keeping the peach border:



## Final Implementation

The web app is fully implemented with a refined UI:
