# Sprint 3 - A Refined and Complete System


## Sprint Goals

Develop the system until it is fully featured, with a refined UI and it satisfies the requirements. The system will be fully tested at this point.

## Updated Database Schema

After fitting the site to mobile devices, we have a problem on the unit stats page:

![Table squashed too small for headings](screenshots/unitStats1.png)

I tried rotating the headings to get the to fit, but even this didn't work:

![Table squashed too small for rotated headings](screenshots/unitStats2.png)

As such, I've spoken with the officers and they think that assigning each role a short abbreviation is best. This should be fine, as the only people with access to this page will know what each abbreviation is - but, considering my relevant implication of accessibility, I will add a tooltip when hovering just in case someone isn't sure.

As such, I've updated my database to give each role an abbreviation:
