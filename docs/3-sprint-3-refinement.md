# Sprint 3 - A Refined and Complete System


## Sprint Goals

Develop the system until it is fully featured, with a refined UI and it satisfies the requirements. The system will be fully tested at this point.

## Updated Database Schema

After fitting the site to mobile devices, we have a problem on the unit stats page:

![Table squashed too small for headings](screenshots/unitStats1.png)

I tried rotating the headings to get the to fit, but even this didn't work:

![Table squashed too small for rotated headings](screenshots/unitStats2.png)

As such, I've spoken with the officers and they think that assigning each role a short abbreviation is best. This should be fine, as the only people with access to this page will know what each abbreviation is - but, considering my relevant implication of accessibility, I will add a tooltip when hovering just in case someone isn't sure.

As such, I've updated my database to give each role an abbreviation:

## Updated Colour Scheme

Now that my website was fully functional, it was time to add colour. 

I showed the final colour sceme to my stakeholers:

![Peach-coloured table](screenshots/allocations_table_1.png)

While they all liked the colour, some members, particually [certian stakeholder group] found it hard to read, therefore accessibility was bad. To maximise accessibility while keeping the aesthetically pleasing colour scheme, I have made the table itself white to maximise contrast, while keeping the peach border:

![White, readable table](screenshots/allocations_table_2.png)

My stakeholders all liked this change.

## Final Implementation

The web app is fully implemented with a refined UI:

![Refined allocations page](screenshots/test_refine_allocations.png)

![Refined roles page](screenshots/test_refine_roles.png)

Note how with the above roles image, we've decided to have the peach colour throughout instead of a white insert. This is based on feedback.

## Testing Features

I'll now go through and test all my website's features. Similarly to the testing in sprint 2, I'll be tesing the functionality, but here I'll also be testing the user experience in terms of usability and asthetics.
